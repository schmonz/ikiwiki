This is very minor. Noticed in nginx's logs that jquery-ui.min.css (the attachment plugin uses this) keeps referencing some png files that are not available in public_html/mywiki/ikiwiki/images/  These should be included in underlays/attachment/ikiwiki/images/ in the source repo and seem to be copied from /usr/local/share/ikiwiki/attachment/ikiwiki/images/  when I compile a new wiki.  The complete list of images jquery-ui.min.css is looking for can be found here. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/1.8.14/themes/base/images

Fair enough. These 3 files are the only ones that appear consistently in nginx error logs.
