I think there's a bug in the code that determines if the cgiurl is relative
to the url. If one has a different port than the other, they're not
relative, and I hear Fil encountered an issue where the wrong port was then
used. --[[Joey]]

After upgrading to 3.20120203 (backported to squeeze) I found that the URLs in the edit page all have the port set as :81 ... but now that I look at it more closely, that is the case for several ikiwiki-hosting controlled sites, but not for a few other sites that are also on the same machine, so it must be some difference between the settings for the sites, either in ikiwiki, or apache, or perhaps even nginx.  Anyway, on the affected sites, explicitly including a port :80 in the cgiurl fixes the problem.
