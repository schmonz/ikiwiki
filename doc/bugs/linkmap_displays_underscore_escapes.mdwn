[[ikiwiki/directive/linkmap]]s display the file name instead of the pagetitle, showing unsightly underscore escapes and underscores instead of blanks to users.

the attached [[!taglink patch]] fixes this; from its commit message:

    display the pagetitle() in linkmaps
    
    without this patch, linkmaps display underscores and underscore escape
    sequences in the rendered output.
    
    this introduces a pageescape function, which invoces pagetitle() to get
    rid of underscore escapes and wraps the resulting utf8 string
    appropriately for inclusion in a dot file (using dot's html encoding
    because it can represent the '\"' dyad properly, and because it doesn't
    need special-casing of newlines).

the output will look much better (at least in my wikis) with the "[[bugs/pagetitle function does not respect meta titles]]" issue fixed.

the patch is stored in [[the patch.pl]] as created by git-format-patch. (btw, what's the preferred way to send patches, apart from creating a git branch somewhere?)
