in ikiwiki instances that don't reside in the git root directory (the only ones i know of are ikiwiki itself), reverts show the wrong link in the recentchanges (for example, in the ikiwiki main repository's 4530430 and its revert, the main index page was edited, but the revert shows doc/index as a link).

the expected behavior is to compensate for the modified root directory (i.e., show index instead of doc/index).
