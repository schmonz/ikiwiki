Under some circumstances that remain unclear to me, the usage of `urlto()` in the revised version of the [[plugins/osm]] plugin break the map totally. The javascript console in Chromium tells me the following:

    GET http://mesh.openisp.ca/map/pois.kml/ 404 (Not Found)

Indeed, that URL yields a 404. The proper URL is <http://mesh.openisp.ca/map/pois.kml>. --[[anarcat]]

## Proposed solution

The problem seems to be caused by `urlto()` being called for the `osm`
directive before the generated files are registered with `will_render()`
from the `waypoint` directive. Proposed patch adds a function that is
called from the `preprocess` hook for both directives that registers the
files.

Here is a [[patch]] to IkiWiki/Plugin/osm.pm: <https://reseaulibre.deuxpi.ca/0000-Fix-incorrect-URL-pointing-to-the-generated-waypoint.patch>

I confirm the patch works, and I added it to my master branch. --[[anarcat]]
