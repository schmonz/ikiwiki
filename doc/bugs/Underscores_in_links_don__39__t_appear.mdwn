Observed behavior:

When I create a link like \[[cmd_test]] , the link appears as 'cmd test'.

Expected behavior:

I would like to be able to create links with underscores. I realize this is a feature, and I searched for ways to escape the underscore so it would appear, but I didn't find any.

> as a workaround, you can use \[[cmd\_\_95\_\_test|cmd_test]] (which will link to a page named "cmd test" at the url location "cmd\_test") or \[[cmd\_\_95\_\_test]] (which will link to a page named "cmd\_test" at the url location "cmd\_\_95\_\_test"). i would, from my limited understanding of ikiwiki internals, consider the bug valid, and suggest that
