I was just trying to get footnotes working on a blog post (strange usecase I suppose) and no matter what I did I wasn't able to get them to work. I tried both Discount and MultiMarkdown, looked at the code in the mdwn.pm file, etc. I finally narrowed it down to the issue being that I was trying to have the footnote definition and reference both inside the text=""" """ block of the !more directive. I haven't looked through the code for the more.pm yet to see why that is happening, but will do so and see if I can figure out a fix. 

EDIT: this was my user error, turns out the footnote comment requires the : following the [^1] in order to work. i'll leave this here in case it helps someone in the future struggling with footnotes. - [[mare]] _Jan 12 2025 18:15PDT_

>> i was wondering, is there support for multiple references to the same footnote on a page? e.g., if i have text[^1] more text[^2] some more text[^1] and

>> [^1] ref 1

>> [^2] ref 2

>> the [^1] on some more text never gets turned into a link to the footnote, nor does a second section link get added to the end of the respective footnote. this is counter to the behavior in my markdown editor (not the most useful benchmark, i know). thanks - [[mare]] _Jan 13 2025_
