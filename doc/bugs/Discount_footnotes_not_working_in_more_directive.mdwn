I was just trying to get footnotes working on a blog post (strange usecase I suppose) and no matter what I did I wasn't able to get them to work. I tried both Discount and MultiMarkdown, looked at the code in the mdwn.pm file, etc. I finally narrowed it down to the issue being that I was trying to have the footnote definition and reference both inside the text=""" """ block of the !more directive. I haven't looked through the code for the more.pm yet to see why that is happening, but will do so and see if I can figure out a fix. 

EDIT: this was my user error, turns out the footnote comment requires the : following the [^1] in order to work. i'll leave this here in case it helps someone in the future struggling with footnotes. - [[mare]] _Jan 12 2025 18:15PDT_
