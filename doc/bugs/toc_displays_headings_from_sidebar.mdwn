The [[/ikiwiki/directive/toc]] directive scrapes all headings from the page, including those in the sidebar.  So, if the sidebar includes navigational headers, every page with a table of contents will display those navigational headers before the headers in that page's content.

I'd like some way to exclude the sidebar from the table of contents.  As discussed via Jabber, perhaps toc could have a config option to ignore headers inside a nav tag or a tag with id="sidebar".
