[[!template id=gitbranch branch=smcv/trail author=smcv]] [[!tag patch]]

`t/trail.t` has some test suite failures. This is after applying
[[smcv]]'s patch that fixed some races that caused it to fail
sometimes. These remaining failures may also be intermittant,
although I can get them reliably on my laptop. I've added some debugging
output, which seems to point to an actual bug in the plugin AFAICS. --[[Joey]]

Here, the "new" page does not seem to be included into the trail as expected.
Looking at the rendered page, there is no trail directive output on it either.

Haven't investigated, but looks like the same sort of problem, a 
page expected to be in the trail isn't. --[[Joey]]
