ikiwiki 3.20120109 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * mdwn: Can use the discount markdown library, via the
     Text::Markdown::Discount perl module. This is preferred if available
     since it's the fastest currently supported markdown library, speeding up
     ikiwiki's markdown rendering by a factor of 40.
     (However, when multimarkdown is enabled, Text::Markdown::Multimarkdown
     is still used.)
   * On Debian, depend on libtext-markdown-discount."""]]
