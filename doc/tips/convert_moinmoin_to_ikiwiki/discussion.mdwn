I look forward to trying this.  I have a large (~10 year old) MoinMoin installation that has been migrated up to a 1.8.x version so far, and which is partially ACL'd away behind logins. — [[Jon]]

> I'll make that clearer in the docs, but we do not deal with ACL (yet?), as ikiwiki doesn't support Moinmoin's level of ACL flexibility. See [[todo/per_page_ACLs]] for more information. --[[anarcat]]

>> I was actually thinking the ACLs would cause a problem just for the crawler, I hadn't considered their re-implementation (but yes, that would be good!) — [[Jon]]
