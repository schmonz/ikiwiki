Just thought people might like to know I've added a couple more plugins to contrib.

[[plugins/contrib/newpage]]: This plugin adds a new action to the "ACTIONS" section of a page; a button labelled "create" and an input field next to it.

The common way of creating a new page is to edit a different page and add a link to the new page. However, there are some situations where that is a nuisance; for example, where pages are listed using a map directive. The newpage plugin enables one to simply type the name of the new page, click the "create" button, and one is then taken to the standard IkiWiki create-page form.

[[plugins/contrib/jssearchfield]]: This plugin provides the [[plugins/contrib/ikiwiki/directive/jssearchfield]] directive.  This
enables one to search the structured data ("field" values) of multiple pages.
This uses Javascript for the searching, which means that the entire thing
is self-contained and does not require a server or CGI access, unlike
the default IkiWiki search. This means that it can be used in places such
as ebook readers.  The disadvantage is that because Javascript runs
in the browser, the searching is only as fast as the machine your browser
is running on.

Because this uses Javascript, the htmlscrubber must be turned off for any page where the directive is used.

This plugin depends on the [[!iki plugins/contrib/field]] plugin.
