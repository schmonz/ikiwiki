Why doesn't the [[plugins/search]] plugin index attachments? are there any
technical reasons for not including this feature/option? (besides increased
processing time, and depending from external programs.)

One could check for all non-mdwn files, convert them to text, if such thing is
possible, and add them as documents; I guess `needsbuild` would be a good site
for that.
