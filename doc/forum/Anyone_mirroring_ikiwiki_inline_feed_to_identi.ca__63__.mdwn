Is anyone successfull mirroring feeds from ikiwiki to identi.ca (or another status.net instance)? How did you set up your feed?

When I try to, identi.ca presents me with an error about no "author ID URI" being found in the feed. Indeed the ikiwiki-generated atom feed only has got a global "author" - I presume identi.ca requires author information in each entry. Is it possible to set up ikiwiki's feed that way?
