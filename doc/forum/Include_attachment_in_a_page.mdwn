Is there any way of embedding an attachment in a page - like, when I upload a picture, I would like to have it showing on a page.... I tried the Markdown image syntax like this:

    ![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

But if you upload a PDF, f.ex., there will be a "broken URL/no image" thumbnail, although the link to the uploaded file works correctly, if entered correctly.

So if it's just an image I want to embed, then I would want to use HTML syntax directly, I guess. (Like stated [[here|http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img]].) But in case it's some other type of attachment it would be nice to be able to have some specific include syntax or the like.

Probably a feature for the "attachment" plugin's wishlist!?
