Sorry, \"failed\" is just the message ikwiki's web interface returns. Nginx's error logs don't seem to register anything when the \"failure\" occurs. I am not sure how to properly monitor what is happening with the web server's memory at the time of uploading but just watching htop I can see that the ikiwiki begins to use 100% if the cpu until the process stops but there doesn't seem to be much impact on the overall memory usage, seems to remain about half of available memory.
I'm sorry if that is not helpful. If you can give me some pointers on where to look for more detailed information I can follow instructions.
