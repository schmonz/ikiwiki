Saying \"it fails\" is not going to get the best help. If you can look in your web server's error.log file, or get a error message from somewhere else, you might get somewhere.

You might also check if the machine is running out of memory. It's quite likely that a POSTed attachment is all buffered in the web server's memory before ikiwiki gets ahold of it.
