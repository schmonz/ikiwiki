hi smcv,

> when a page is viewed, the web server serves the compiled HTML without IkiWiki being involved.

yes you are right, but I still think its a feature ;)

> The best way to integrate access control into IkiWiki would probably be to have a CGI user interface for .htaccess or equivalent - but you'd still have to be careful, because, for instance, if a user can edit public pages, then they can insert a \[[!include]] directive to make the content of a private page public. 

My usecase is a website with an small internal area, its just for not \"so public\" files, no private files. And I only have some trusted users.

thx
