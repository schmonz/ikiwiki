Hi.

If I create a page and attach a file to the page, ikiwiki creates a sub-directory with the page name and places the attachment in the sub-directory regardless of usedirs setup. Is there any setup not to create the sub-directory and to place the attachment in the same directory where the page is, so that I can edit and properly *preview* at a local machine using third-party markdown editors?

Thanks in advance.
