Forgive me if I don't fully understand the question, but:

 * the attachment functionality includes a button \"Insert Links\" which, on the edit form for a page, inserts the correct markup to link to the attachment, which addresses the general case

 * For images which you want inline, you could convert the basic wikilink e.g. `\[[foo.png]]` into a call to the [[plugins/img]] plugin e.g. `\[[!img foo.png]]`
