Hi,

unfortunately, openID is not working at my wiki. I get the error

no_identity_server: The provided URL doesn't declare its OpenID identity server.

I think this is related to the ID of my wiki not being defined right. Where and how do I have to define it? I have used the !meta openid as described on ikiwiki.info (are there two quotes at the end where only one should be (joeyh example) on index.html. 

Somehow I think its not transferred right to the openID provider of the user upon login.

thanks in advance
chris
