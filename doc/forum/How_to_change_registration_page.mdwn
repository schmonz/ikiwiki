Well, I simply don't see it.
I would like to change the "account registration" page, where it says user, password, repeat password, Account Creation Password, E-Mail.  

I simply want it to ask a question like "Who's your daddy" or "What are we all working on" instead of "Account creation password".

I already grepped through the files of the source which I compiled ikiwiki from - I just can't find it. I'm a noob in cgi, it seems to be somewhat in there, but that could also be totally wrong.

Can you tell me where to look?
