`\[[!tag]]` does not produce any output in the body of the page, but
stores an invisible tag (which, in the default templates, gets displayed
in the footer of the page).

For instance, this

    Here is some text about badgers
    \[[!tag badger]]

or this

    \[[!tag badger]]
    Here is some text about badgers

or even this

    Here is some text about \[[!tag badger]]badgers

will all come out like this:

    Edit | RecentChanges | etc.
    ----
    Here is some text about badgers
    ----
    tags: badger

`\[[!taglink]]` produces a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]] in the body of the
page, *and* stores an invisible tag like `\[[!tag]]`.

So this:

    Some text about \[[!tag mushrooms]] and toadstools

renders like this

    Edit | RecentChanges | etc.
    ----
    Some text about _mushrooms_ and toadstools
    ----
    tags: mushrooms

where `_mushrooms_` represents a hyperlink.
