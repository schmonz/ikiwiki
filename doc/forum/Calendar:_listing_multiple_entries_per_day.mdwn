Hi,

I'd very much like to be able to list my blog posts on a daily basis (used for logging work) - rather than have the Calendar plugin return the first post only.

There was some effort to do this as detailed here.

[[todo/Set_arbitrary_date_to_be_used_by_calendar_plugin]]

I had a quick go at doing something similar on Debian Stable (Ikiwiki 3.0) but alas my Ikiwiki fu is not strong enough.

I'm not sure how I go about swapping the link on the day number to a link to, I guess, a dynamically generated page of links?

    $linkcach{"$year/$mtag/$mday"}{$p} = ${p}

and a suitable whilst loop looks to be all that's needed...

Any pointers appreciated.

A [[!taglink patch]] has been proposed in [comment](#comment-d6f94e2b779d1c038b6359aad79ed14b)
