I've [just learned](https://pleroma.debian.social/notice/AmEPTRoZiQifOD3hce) about [paged feeds](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005): an RFC proposal for linking separate feed URIs together via `<link rel=prev`, `<link rel=next` etc. to specify an ordering.

The purpose is to support pagination of feeds: have (say) 5 entries in your most recent URI, and then the next 5 (or so) in another file/URI, that a compliant reader could fetch if required (or not, if not desired).

This might improve bandwidth for full-text entry/large entry feeds. It also might help with flooding aggregators, assuming the aggregators didn't blindly follow the links.

I've no idea what client support is like. Does this sound interesting to anyone? *â€” [[Jon]], 2024-09-23*
