Hi! My wiki is behind a proxy and, as I understood looking in the web, I need to set the environment variables using ENV inside the wiki's config.

So far I tried:

ENV: {
  http_proxy => 'http://proxy.uns.edu.ar:1280/',
  https_proxy => 'http://proxy.uns.edu.ar:1280/'
}

without luck, as I get:


YAML::XS::Load Error: The problem:

    found unexpected ':'

was found at document: 1, line: 85, column: 22
while scanning a plain scalar at line: 85, column: 3
usage: ikiwiki [options] source dest
       ikiwiki --setup configfile

What am I missing? (maybe learning perl?)
