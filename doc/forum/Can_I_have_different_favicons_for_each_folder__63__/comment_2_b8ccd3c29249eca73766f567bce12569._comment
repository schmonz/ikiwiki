I did as you suggested (finally) and created a simple modification of the [[plugins/favicon]] plugin: [[plugins/contrib/localfavicon]]. It checks for the \"localfavicon\" option, and if it is set, it uses bestlink() to determine which favicon to use for each page; if not, it behaves just like the original favicon plugin.
