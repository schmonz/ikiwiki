Several users will post to the same blog. I would like the meta "author" field to be set to their ikiwiki username automatically and attached to their posts such that they can not alter it. I imagine one could use the \<TMPL_VAR USER> variable in the "inlinepage" template, but this variable does not seem to be set. How can I accomplish that?

Related question: is there a way to see all the variables which are set and their value?
