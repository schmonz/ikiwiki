Hi,

I just recently migrated my pyblosxom installation to ikiwiki (see <http://blog.well-adjusted.de/posts/>). Should have done that years ago!

Anyway, so far my only problem is that `ikiwiki --setup mysite.setup` creates a directory named `tmp` in the directory containing my postings, together with an empty index.html. It happens every time if I do a complete rebuild. It does not happen every time with `--refresh`. For example, editing only `local.css` does not trigger the behaviour. Editing any posting will do, but that triggers a complete rebuild anyway due to my sidebar with the tag cloud.

Do you have any idea what might cause this or how I should proceed to find it out? I am a programmer but know next to nothing about Perl.

Thanks,
Jochen.
