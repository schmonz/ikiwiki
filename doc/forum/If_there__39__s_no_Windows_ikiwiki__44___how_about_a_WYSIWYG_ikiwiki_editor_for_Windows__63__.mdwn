Since ikiwiki doesn't have much of a chance of working in windows, how about we compromise by making an offline ikiwiki editor for Windows? In fact, it might be advantageous to use it in Linux, too...

It should be very simple: It would enter the source wiki and show the Markdown code by default, but would have an option to preview your page in another tab.

Basic features:

* wikilinks, maps, images, inlinepages, and other basic functions should all work in the preview
* perhaps use local.css to format preview
* See the DVCS history with diffs and all
* have a discussion tab to easily see what other people have said about the page

If we want to add some more bells and whistles, maybe we could throw in some buttons to insert markdown formatting (like in forums, mediawiki, or RES).

Any thoughts on this?
