I reviewed my patch queue and you merged a bunch, so first off, thanks for that and all the work you've done on ikiwiki, this is great!

Those are the patches I have left, I think:

- [[todo/allow_toc_to_skip_entries]]: i'm not sure i want this anymore, but it's something i have on my side... it's a bit messy
- [[bugs/javascript_resources_placed_after_html_tag]]: trivial compatibility / performance fix
- [[bugs/footnotes-look-weird]]: style tweak, got tangled up in markdown dialects issues, not sure what the next step is, i have [other tweaks to the base CSS](https://anarc.at/bootstrap.local.css), but some of them are relevant only to my bootstrap theme, unfortunately

There might be other patches flying around my git repo... I had essentially given up on submitting patches here, but once this release goes out, I'll cleanup my house and rebase everything on top to make sure I'm not missing anything.

In general, I'm really excited about the dark mode, and I'm wondering if i should just rebuild my theme on top of the base actiontabs thing now... 

Thanks again!
