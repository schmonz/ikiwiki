To be clear, this patch creates a `yyyy/mm/dd` file for each day, listing the posts for that day, so the calendar can link to it rather than a random single post.

While a valid solution certainly, that's a lot of added pages! Especially a high overhead for such a minor UI point as this.

Surely something interesting could be done with javascript or some other form of UI to make clicking on a day in a calendar that has multiple posts present a list of them? That would have essentially no overhead, since the calendar plugin already has a list of the posts made on a given day. 

Ikiwiki already does something similar to deal with the case where a page has a great many backlinks.. It makes a UI element that, if hovered over, pops up a display of all the rest. This is done quite simply in the `page.tmpl`
using the popup and balloon CSS classes. Calendar could also use this.
