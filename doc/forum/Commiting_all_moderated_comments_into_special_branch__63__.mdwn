I only interact with ikiwiki via cli & git; thus I would love to be able to moderate comments via git from all remote checkouts without being forced to ssh to my server and do that locally.

Is anyone aware of a way to check all comments into a special branch, possibly called "moderation", and with a normal suffix, not "_comment_pending"? That would allow me to cherry-pick from that branch without having to remember to rename and simply delete all spam etc from the branch.

Every now and then, I could delete the whole branch, thus cleaning out crud. As the approved comments live in master, that would not be a problem.
