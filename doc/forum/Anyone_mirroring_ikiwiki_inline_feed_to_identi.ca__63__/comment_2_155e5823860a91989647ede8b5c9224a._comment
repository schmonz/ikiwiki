I did some more experiments setting not only \"[[!meta author=...\", but also \"authorurl\" globally and per-entry in various combinations, with no success. As far as I could see, \"authorurl\" had no effect on the atom feed whatsoever.

It seems that identi.ca wants a feed to have an <author> field with a <uri> subfield, as described here: [[http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/#person]] . Is there a way to achieve this with ikiwiki inline-feeds?

I also found two old and unresolved status.net bugreports on the matter:
