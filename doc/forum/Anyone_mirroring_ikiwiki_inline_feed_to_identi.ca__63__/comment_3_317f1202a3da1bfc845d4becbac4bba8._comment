The templates atompage.tmpl and/or atomitem.tmpl appear to be what would have to be altered to satisfy identi.ca. I did that on my system, just hard-coding a <uri> element into <author> for testing. In one respect, it worked: identi.ca does not complain about the missing author uri any more. In another, it did not, another error comes up now: \"Internal server error\" and something like \"could not add feed\".

I do not know where to go from this very unspecific error message. I guess I am going to try something like twitterfeed.com, for now.
