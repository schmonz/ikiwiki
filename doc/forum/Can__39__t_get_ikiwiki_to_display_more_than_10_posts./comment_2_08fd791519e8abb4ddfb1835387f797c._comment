Ok, thanks.  I know next to nothing about ikiwiki, but it appears that the FreedomBox places the blog files in /var/lib/ikiwiki/<name-of-blog>.  From there:

    find . -type f -exec grep 'show=\"10\"' {} \; -print
    [[!inline pages=\"page(./posts/*) and !*/Discussion\" show=\"10\"
    ./index.mdwn
    grep: ./.ikiwiki/sessions.db: Permission denied
    grep: ./.ikiwiki/userdb: Permission denied

so replaced the show=\"10\" with show=\"100\" but no change.  Turns out that change doesn't propagate until a blog rebuild is done.  So, changed the numbacklinks to 100 from the ikiwiki interface and after the rebuild was done, I now see all posts.

The ikiwiki version on the FreedomBox is 3.20200202.3-1 (per aptitude).  Not sure if newer versiona have this variable settable from the \"setup\" page, but it would be a good idea.
