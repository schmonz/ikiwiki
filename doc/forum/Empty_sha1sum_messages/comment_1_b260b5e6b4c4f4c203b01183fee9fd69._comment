Hmm, this is a debug message, so only printed or logged if verbose mode is enabled. As far as I can see, in normal operation this could only happen if you use the web interface to edit a page that's coming originally from ikiwiki's underlay -- such as `ikiwiki/pagespec.mdwn`, or a page in the srcdir whose file is indeed not checked into git for some reason.

Doesn't seem useful, so I've nuked the message.
