Hello,

For example the page [[plugins/tag|plugins/tag]] here is tagged type/link and type/tags, what gets listed exactly so below the page's content. However, when I use tags like concept/getopt or lang/Perl on my private wiki, it gets only listed as getopt and Perl. Is this behavior configurable or is it implemented firstly in a version later than 3.20100815~bpo50+1 (for which I'm stuck ATM.)?

Greetings,  
 Mike Dornberger
