Unfortunately, ikiwiki [[doesn't follow symlinks for security
reasons|security]] - if it did, anyone who can commit to the wiki
repository could publish any file readable by the user who runs ikiwiki,
including secrets like `~/.gnupg/secring.gpg` or
`~/.ssh/identity`.

git-annex relies on symlinks, so that restriction breaks it.
It would be great to be able to use some restricted, safe subset
of symlinks (\"relative symlinks that point into `.git/annex`\" would
be enough to support git-annex), and I've looked into it in the past.
My [[plugins/contrib/album]] plugin would benefit from being able
to annex the actual photos, for instance.
