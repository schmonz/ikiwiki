Hi,

running ikiwiki from squeeze backports I see frequently in the logs:

> Empty sha1sum for 'ikiwiki/pagespec.mdwn'.

The page varies. What are these messages about? The code that emits this
comes from the git plugin, and this page is indeed not in git. So is
this just noise? Or rather, why does ikiwiki need to look at these?

thanks in advance!
