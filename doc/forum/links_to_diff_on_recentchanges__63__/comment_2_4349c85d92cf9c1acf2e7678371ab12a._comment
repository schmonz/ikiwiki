Thanks, that was just the ticket :). My ikiwiki.setup file didn't even have a commented out diffurl in it - is there a handy list of configuration-variables somewhere? I thought the theory was that ikiwiki.setup was generated with (commented out) nearly all the config variables already mentioned?

[FWIW, I'm using the version in Debian stable]
