Did you enable the [[plugins/404]] plugin?

Which web server? That plugin is meant to work with Apache 2; in
principle it should be possible to make it work with other web servers,
but it'll need some setup.

The 404 plugin relies on your web server giving IkiWiki some extra
information about 404s; lighttpd doesn't currently provide enough
information for IkiWiki to detect 404s reliably, for instance.
