Unfortunately debian stable / squeeze repos are still on version 3.20100815.7

Do you think squeeze will update to a newer version soon? I am lacking support of the gallery plugin and 1 more that I forgot right now  ;)

Is everyone else upgrading by directly installing via dpkg (no updates, but yeah)?

Regards
