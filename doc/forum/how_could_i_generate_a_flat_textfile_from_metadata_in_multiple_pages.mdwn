I am already using the [[plugins/contrib/report]] plugin to generate reports aggregated from multiple pages, and it's great! However, I am now looking at generating non-HTML reports. Basically, I want to generate a BIND zonefile from the data aggregated from similar reports. I have gone as far as using the [[plugins/pagetemplate]] plugin to have an empty page as a template - but even that bit doesn't work as i still get pesky `<script>` tags in the output. Besides, the data actually gets parsed on display, and I'd like to do some validation and processing.

How should I go forward? Should i write a separate plugin from [[plugins/contrib/report]]? Should I make a plugin that, like [[plugins/graphviz]] generates data in a separate page? Any suggestions? --[[anarcat]]
