I'm using ikiwiki package from Debian squeeze and I can't seem
to be able to make OpenID work.  It's a blog and when I try to
add a comment and click on SignIn, I'm redirected to

>http://my.site/ikiwiki.cgi?do=commentsignin


Once I click on Google logo/icon, it takes a while before showing

>no_identity_server: The provided URL doesn't declare its OpenID identity server.


It's not clear for me what's wrong or if I should add meta openid in some page.
This is the version of libnet-openid-consumer-perl: 1.03-1.  It also fails for
Yahoo! and other providers, we never get redirected to Google/Yahoo! or other
verification page.

Thank you in advance!
