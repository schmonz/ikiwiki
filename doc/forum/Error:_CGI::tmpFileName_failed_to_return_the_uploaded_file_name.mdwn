I tried to upload a file to my wiki last week, and got this error:

    Error: CGI::tmpFileName failed to return the uploaded file name

This used to work, and I honestly don't know what could have changed to screw it up.

I see that there's a lot of frustrated comments around this particular block of code in `attachment.pm`; so, for the record, I'm on Debian 6, using perl `5.10.1-17squeeze4`.

Any thoughts?
