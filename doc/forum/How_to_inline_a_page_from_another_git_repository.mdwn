I am migrating a dev site which was previously using Trac.

Some of the wiki pages include RST documents from the code repository. What would be the best way to do this using ikiwiki? I would prefer not to include the full code repository in ikiwiki src as there are many source files I do not want to be processed by ikiwiki.

A possible solution would be something like underlay, but for which only explicitly named files would be processed by ikiwiki.
