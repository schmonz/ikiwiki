Nothing wrong with 3.20100815.7 unless you need newer features.

At Branchable we run Debian stable and backport the current ikiwiki to run on it. This is quite easy to do, it just builds and works. (Edit debian/control and s/markdown-discount/markdown/)

It's probably time someone released a backport. I have historically not done that myself though.
