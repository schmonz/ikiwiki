Thanks Joey, also for the replacement hint, had to install one or two dependencies and it worked like a charm. Version from the day before yesterday now. (Awesome!)

I have not upgraded the mypage.setup file, yet. I included \"headinganchors\" which does not seem to work right now. The page compiles without errors but contains no anchors when viewed in browser. Hm..

Great job thanks again!
