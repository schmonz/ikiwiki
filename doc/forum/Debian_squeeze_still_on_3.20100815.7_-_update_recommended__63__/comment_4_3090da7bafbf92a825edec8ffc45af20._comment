just for the record - I created a new wiki and the setup file is then automatically in YAML format. I think I am going to just transfer the settings from the \"old\" setup file to the new one. 

If anyone has an idea why the headinganchors don't work, pls let me know. 

As for the rest - insanely cool piece of software - great
