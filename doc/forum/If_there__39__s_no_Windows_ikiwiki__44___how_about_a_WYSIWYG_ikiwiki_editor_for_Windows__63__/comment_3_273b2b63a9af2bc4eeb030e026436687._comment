Like, there's already a whole host of Markdown previewer apps that are pretty good. [Here's a](http://www.macworld.com/article/164744/2012/01/marked_excels_at_previewing_markdown_and_html_documents.html) popular one on Mac, and there are many more...

There's also a plugin for Emacs that does so, and even resolves wikilinks (in some way..).

But I'd have to say that I probably made a misleading title, WYSIWYG would probably be low on the list of needed features. And I'm just dumping an idea I have here in case anyone has any suggestions or comments, I'll probably do it myself in my free time.
