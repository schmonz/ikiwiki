Eh, ok, lol. I know that implementing most of the wiki features over again could be difficult, and so would a Git diff reader, but it shouldn't be that hard to get Wikilinking or a markdown previewer working.

Could you point out some specific problems of this approach, so that it would help me out to do so?
