In a Ikiwiki instance, I made a subdirectory to hold blog pages

    /website
    blog.mdwn
    ...

    /website/blog
    /website/blog/blog1.mdwn
    /website/blog/blog2.mdwn
    ...

On blog.mdwn,  reader by default see the last 10 posts, but it seems there is no link to blog pages older than that. What's a good way to make titles of blog pages older also somehow visible to reader at the blog front page `blog.mdwn`?

On any individual blog page such as `blog1.mdwn`, there is not a link to the blog pages immediately before and after it. How to make such links?
