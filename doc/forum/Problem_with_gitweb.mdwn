I use gitweb to display the pagehistories of my local ikiwiki. However since a few weeks it doesn't work anymore and displays just: 404 - No such project. I don't remember that I changed something with my wiki. Any ideas how to fix this? I guess that it could be a permission problem, however I don't really know which permissions are important in this case.
