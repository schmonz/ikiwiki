I know that these pages exist on ikiwiki.info:

* http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/formatting/
* http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/subpage/

But I can't get either to show up in Google search results.  I have even tried:
> site:ikiwiki.info inurl:formatting

and

> site:ikiwiki.info inurl:formatting -inurl:discussion

...Is this some robots.txt problem?
