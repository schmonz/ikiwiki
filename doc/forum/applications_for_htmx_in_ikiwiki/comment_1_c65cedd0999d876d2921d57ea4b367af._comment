I'm not sure. We already have jquery in ikiwiki (or at least it's there in my site) and it's one of those huge blobs i'd like to get rid of.

I'd love to have more \"live\" previews, but the blocker for this right now is not, IMHO, Javascript or browser-level interactivity, it's how *slow* ikiwiki is over CGI. There's a *single* CGI endpoint that has huge lock contention: that's most of where people spend time when doing comments or, frankly, anything, through the web interface.

Unless we fix that *first*, i doubt any live thing like this will be anywhere near useful... I'm also not convinced we *need* htmx to do the things you're refering to here, but i'm not a frontend developer and i'm old, so i could very well be wrong about that. :) -- [[anarcat]]
