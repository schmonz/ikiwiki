I agree, the big locks are a pressing issue and will limit the usefulness of anything like this. 

I’d hope that something like this could be optional, and unless opted in you wouldn’t pay the price (= need to bundle the js)

I’m sure the same could be achieved without htmx, but it might be an especially quick/ergonomic way to achieve it.
