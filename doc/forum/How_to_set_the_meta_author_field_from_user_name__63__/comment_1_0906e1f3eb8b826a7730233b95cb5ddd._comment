This does not seem to be possible directly according to the discussion here: [[Possible to use meta variables in templates?]].

The solution I chose in the end was to set up a template which prepares the meta and suggests the author to fill it in with his user name. Maybe the best way would be to create actually one blog per author, define a template for each author (based on the pagespec and on the lockedpages to constrain authors to write only on their blog) and then an inline page which includes all the individual blogs.
