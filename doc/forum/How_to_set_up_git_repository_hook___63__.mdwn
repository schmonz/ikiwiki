Hi,

I want to set up hooks for Git, and I don't know how to. Is there any documentation somewhere? Basically, I'd like to do what [[/ikiwiki-makerepo]] does, but manually.

Why? Because I want to have a special layout to my repository. Especially, I want to include at the root level some special files:

- the nginx configuration
- the script that installs the nginx configuration to the system
- the script that starts the fast-cgi wrapper
- the `ikiwiki.setup` file
- ...

And I want the ikiwiki sources to be in a subdirectory `src/` and the generated files in `out/` (where the nginx configuration points).

So, what is the special `post-update` hook generated by [[/ikiwiki-makerepo]]? I noticed it was an ELF file, why not a script? What does it do?

Thanks,

Mildred
