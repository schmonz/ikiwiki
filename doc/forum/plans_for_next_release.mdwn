I'd like to cut a new release this year, in particular to ship

* [[todo/support for light and dark mode]]
* [[todo/add a search plugin that uses duckduckgo]]
* po.pm: fixes for po4a ≥ 0.70
* [[todo/admonitions]]
* [[bugs/backlinks onhover thing can go weird]]
* [[todo/Make recentchanges CGI more configurable]] (hopefully)

Is there anything else that people are particularly interested in?
