I use both [[plugins/moderatedcomments/]] and [[plugins/anonok]] on my [blog](http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz) but having to remember to visit the comment moderation page manually is not ideal.

Is there a way to get an email notification (or maybe even just an RSS feed) whenever a new comment enters the moderation queue?
