A theme provides a style.css file, and any associated images to give
ikiwiki a nice look and feel. The local.css [[CSS]] file is left
free for you to further customize.

Ikiwiki now comes with several themes contributed by users.
You can enable the [[theme_plugin|plugins/theme]] to use any of these:

[[!img actiontabs_small.png align=left]] The **actiontabs** theme, contributed by
[[svend]]. This style sheet displays the action list
(Edit, RecentChanges, etc.) as tabs.

<br clear="both" />

[[!img blueview_small.png align=left]] The **blueview** theme, contributed by
[[BerndZeimetz]], featuring a tiling panoramic photo he took.

<br clear="both" />

[[!img goldtype_small.png align=left]] The **goldtype** theme, based on
blueview and featuring the photography of Lars Wirzenius.

<br clear="both" />

[[!img monochrome_small.png align==left]] The **monochrome** theme,
based on [[Jon]]'s homepage design.

<br clear="both" />

[[!img none_small.png align=left]] For completeness, ikiwiki's default
anti-theme.
