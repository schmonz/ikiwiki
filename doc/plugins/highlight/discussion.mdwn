It would be nice to be able to set a few options for the highlighter
object. In particular, today I noticed my tabs were not being expanded
correctly, which could be fixed the command line with --replace-tabs but
programmatically needs a call to setPreformatting.  I could probably play
with this, but what is your preferred way to support options? something
like 'highlight_options=>{replace_tabs=>8,line_numbers=>0}' ?  Of course,
if you want to implement it I won't complain :-). [[DavidBremner]]

Has anyone got this running with CentOS/RHEL ?   
Having trouble working out where to get the perl bindings for highlight. --[Mick](http://www.lunix.com.au)

Thanks for prompt reply.All working. I will post on my site tonight and link here what I did on CentOS to make this work. --[Mick](http://www.lunix.com.au) 

Any hint on how to highlight actual mdwn or any other supported markup code? -- [wiebel](http://wiebels.info)
