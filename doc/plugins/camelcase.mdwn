[[!template id=plugin name=camelcase author="[[Joey]]"]]

This plugin makes words in CamelCase be treated as a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]].
That is to say, any two or more words capitalised and mashed together are
assumed to be the name of some other page on the wiki, and so become a
link.

If this plugin is enabled, this will be a link: SandBox

Use of this plugin is not recommended, particularly on complex wikis with
things like [[aggregate]] in use.

[[!tag type/link]]
