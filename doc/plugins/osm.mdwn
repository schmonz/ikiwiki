## Openstreetmap/Openlayers support for ikiwiki

This plugin provides simple Openstreetmap/Openlayers support for ikiwiki.
It can embed Openstreetmap viewports within a page or link to a bigger map
that will have multiple markers, generated with a KML (or CSV, or GeoJSON)
datafile of markers based on the different calling pages. Multiple distinct
maps on a single wiki are supported.

You will need the [[!cpan XML::Writer]] perl module to write KML files,
which is the default mode of operation. GeoJSON files can also be generated
if the [[!cpan JSON]] perl module is installed.

This provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/waypoint]] and [[ikiwiki/directive/osm]] directives.

The plugin was originally written by
[[the techno-viking|http://techno-viking.com/posts/ikiwiki-maps/]] and fixed up
by [[anarcat]]. 

See [[the Mtl-mesh
wiki|http://mesh.openisp.ca/nodes/anarcat]] for a sample of what this
plugin can do

See also [[plugins/contrib/googlemaps]].

This plugin would be greatly improved by
[[todo/internal_definition_list_support]].
