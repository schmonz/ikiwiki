This plugin provides a [[ikiwiki/directive/teximg]] [[ikiwiki/directive]],
that renders LaTeX formulas into images.

Of course you will need LaTeX installed for this to work.

## configuration

There are several configuration directives that can be used in the setup
file. `teximg_prefix` can be set to change the LaTeX preamble, and
`teximg_postfix` to change the LaTeX postfix. The `teximg_dvipng` setting
can be set to 0 to disable use of `dvipng`, and instead force use of `dvips`
and `convert`.
