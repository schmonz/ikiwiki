This plugin adds a search form to the wiki, using DuckDuckGo's site search.

DuckDuckGo is asked to search for pages in the domain specified in the wiki's
`url` configuration parameter. Results will depend on whether DuckDuckGo has
indexed the site, and how recently.

By comparison the [[search]] plugin offers full text search of only the wiki,
but requires that a search engine be installed on your site.
