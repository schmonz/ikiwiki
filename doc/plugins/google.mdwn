This plugin adds a search form to the wiki, using google's site search.

Google is asked to search for pages in the domain specified in the wiki's
`url` configuration parameter. Results will depend on whether google has
indexed the site, and how recently.

The [[search]] plugin offers full text search of only the wiki, but
requires that a search engine be installed on your site.
