This plugin allows wiki admins to configure the wiki using a web interface,
rather than editing the setup file directly. A "Setup" button is added
to the admins' preferences page.

Warning: This plugin rewrites your setup file. Any comments or unusual
things (such as perl code) in the setup file will not be preserved. Also,
it will only work correctly with new format setup files, as introduced in
ikiwiki 2.60. Older setup files have a "wrappers" section, which will not
be properly preserved if this plugin is used.

Most settings can be modified using the web interface. Plugins can be
enabled and disabled using it too. Some settings are not considered safe
enough to be manipulated over the web; these are still shown, by default,
but cannot be modified. To hide them, set `websetup_show_unsafe` to false
in the setup file. A few settings have too complex a data type to be
configured via the web. To mark additional settings as unsafe, you can
list them in `websetup_unsafe`.

Plugins that should not be enabled/disabled via the web interface can be
listed in `websetup_force_plugins` in the setup file.

When the setup is saved, the setup file will be rewritten with the new
settings, and the wiki will be refreshed, or rebuilt, to make the setup
changes take effect.
