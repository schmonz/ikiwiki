[[!tag type/auth type/comments]]

This plugin causes [[comments]] to be held for manual moderation.
Admins can access the comment moderation queue via their preferences page.

By default, all comments made by anyone who is not an admin will be held
for moderation. The `moderate_pagespec` setting can be used to specify a
[[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] to match comments and users who should be moderated.
For example, to avoid moderating comments from logged-in users, set
`moderate_pagespec` to "`!user(*)`". Or to moderate everyone except for
admins, set it to "`!admin(*)`".
