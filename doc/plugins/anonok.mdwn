By default, anonymous users cannot edit the wiki. This plugin allows
anonymous web users, who have not signed in, to edit any page in the wiki
by default.

Please think twice before enabling this plugin. If your wiki is accessible
to the internet, it *will* be subject to spamming if this plugin is
enabled. Such spam is not only a pain to deal with, but it bloats the
revision control history of your wiki.

The plugin has a configuration setting, `anonok_pagespec`. This
[[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] can be used to allow anonymous editing of matching pages.

If you're using the [[comments]] plugin, you can allow anonymous comments
to be posted by setting:

	anonok_pagespec => "postcomment(*)"
