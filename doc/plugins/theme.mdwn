The theme plugin allows easily applying a theme to your wiki, by
configuring the `theme` setting in the setup file with the name of a theme
to use. The themes you can choose from are all subdirectories, typically
inside `/usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/`. See [[themes]] for an overview
of the themes included in ikiwiki and the [[theme market]] for third party themes.

You can set the theme via the **theme** option in your config file (after
enabling the plugin). Refresh the wiki (with `ikiwiki -setup <file>`, `--setup` won't work, they are not interchangable) after changing it to see the changes.

Hints for theme builders
------------------------

 * Start from an existing [[CSS file|css]], see also the [[css market]] for examples
 * You can override the [[templates]] files by dropping them in a `templates` subdirectory
 * Try to stick with modifying the CSS however, maintaining custom templates is harder
