[WMD](http://wmd-editor.com/) is a What You See Is What You Mean editor for
[[mdwn]]. This plugin makes WMD be used for editing pages in the wiki.

To use the plugin, you will need to install WMD. Download the [WMD
source](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/).  In that zip file
you'll find a few example html files, a readme and `wmd` directory.  Create
a 'wmd' subdirectory in the ikiwiki `underlaydir` directory (ie `sudo mkdir
/usr/share/ikiwiki/wmd`). Move the `wmd` directory into the directory you
made. You should now have a `wmd/wmd/wmd.js` file as well as some other
javascript files and an images directory in the same place.

Note that the WMD plugin does **not** handle ikiwiki directives.  For this
reason the normal `preview` button remains.
