This plugin allows adding links a list of mirrors to each page in the
wiki. For each mirror, a name and an url should be specified. Pages are
assumed to exist in the same location under the specified url on each
mirror.

In case the `usedirs` setting is not the same on all your mirrors, or
if it is not the same on your local wiki as on the mirror a
possibility is to let each mirror's ikiwiki CGI find out the correct
target page url themselves; in that case the mirrors urls must be set
to their ikiwiki CGI url instead of their base url. Example:

	mirrorlist_use_cgi => 1,
	mirrorlist => {
		'mirror1' => 'https://mirror.example.org/ikiwiki.cgi',
		'mirror2' => 'https://mirror2.example.org/ikiwiki.cgi',
	},

The mirrors must have the ikiwiki CGI and the [[goto]] plugin enabled
for this to work.
