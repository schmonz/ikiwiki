# Admonitions

This plugin adds directives that allow users to outline certain
sections of text using a custom style sheet and bright icons.

5 directives are available:

* [[ikiwiki/directive/tip]]
* [[ikiwiki/directive/note]]
* [[ikiwiki/directive/important]]
* [[ikiwiki/directive/caution]]
* [[ikiwiki/directive/warning]]

For example:

    \[[!tip "Admonitions should be used with care. A page riddled with admonitions will look restless and will be harder to follow than a page where admonitions are used sparingly."]]

This will render as:

<div class="tip">Admonitions should be used with care. A page riddled
with admonitions will look restless and will be harder to follow than
a page where admonitions are used sparingly.</div>

Here's other examples:

<div class="note">
The directive only creates a `<div>` with the appropriate style. You
can of course create a `<div>` yourself. For example, the following
will create an important section:

    <div class="important">You can't put admonitions inside
    admonitions. First, the CSS does not support that, and second,
    that would be silly.!</div>

... like this:
</div>

... well, like this really:

<div class="important">You can't put admonitions inside
admonitions. First, the CSS does not support that, and second, that
would be silly.</div>

Also:

<span/><div class="caution">Note that markup does not work inside
directives. For that, use the DIV tag directly. Keep in mind that
Markdown has some quirks as to parsing markup inside HTML blocks: it
needs to think that it is a "span" element, so you can prefix your
`<div>` with a `<span/>` element to force it to be parsed.</div>

And finally:

<div class="warning">Use warnings where there is a risk of bodily harm
or data loss.</div>

The admonition plugin does not need to be enabled for the `<div>` to
render properly. The plugin only enables the directive shortcuts, the
CSS and icons are always available.

# Rationale

The idea behind the directives is to make the the CSS elements easier
to discover through the builtin documentation. Obviously, more
admonitions can be created simply by adding similar icons and CSS
elements. Of course, you will not get the above directives expanded
automatically unless you patch the admonition plugin, unfortunately.
