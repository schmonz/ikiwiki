[[!tag patch]]

This plugin counts words in a page. For a single page, write a
`\[[!wordcount]]` directive and the word count will be interpolated there.
For a site, add `<TMPL_VAR WORDCOUNT>` to your [[templates]].

If [[!cpan HTML::Strip]] is installed, the wordcount will be slightly
more accurate.

Possible enhancements:

* Optimize: count words iff the result will be displayed. `sanitize()`
  seems like the right place to count. Since it's called well after
  `preprocess()`, I can tell whether a directive needs the result,
  but since it appears to be called before `pagetemplate()`, I can't
  tell whether a template wants to know and possibly skip the
  computation. (In other words, if I add `$needed_for_template`
  like `$needed_for_directive`, it gets set too late for `sanitize()`
  to see.)
