How is this better than creating an inline with `rootpage` set, 
which creates a similar new page form? I sometimes make the inline match
nothing, while still creating pages, in the odd cases where I have a map 
or such displaying the pages. --[[Joey]]

The "working" site is on an internal server, where it is set up as a wiki that authorized users in the company can edit.  When they're satisfied with the changes they've made, the "working" site gets pushed (with git) to the "production" site, which is on a different server.  The ikiwiki setup for the production site has editing completely disabled, because it is the site which is exposed to the outside world.
