This plugin enables ikiwiki to open outbound connections (such as
found in [[plugins/aggregate]], [[plugins/openid]], and [[plugins/pinger]])
via a proxy. The proxy can be configurably avoided for connections
to certain domains.

### To do

* Move duplicated user-agent setup out of other plugins into this one.
* While I'm at it, fix [[bugs/http_proxy_for_openid]].
