I would like to contribute a theme I created and posted on github:

[[https://github.com/AntPortal/ikiwiked]]

For an example of the theme in action, see: [[https://antportal.com/wiki/]]

> Shouldn't we just make people post their themes in the [[themes]] page? Or maybe we should make a [[theme market]]? --[[anarcat]]

> I did just that. -- [[anarcat]]
