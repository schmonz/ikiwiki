[[!tag patch todo wishlist]]

I several updates to the mediawiki plugin to improve compatibility, improving img and File: support.  I'd love to get them upstream.  Is there any interest?  Patches are at [[http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/IKIWIKI/index.html]]

> The mediawiki plugin has never been included in ikiwiki, it's
> [provided by a third party](https://github.com/jmtd/mediawiki.pm) and
> you should send your patches to them.
