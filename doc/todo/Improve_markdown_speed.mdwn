I'm not sure where the bottleneck is for running ikiwiki over a site like
my blog
[Natalian](http://source.natalian-org.branchable.com/?p=source.git;),
though I like to think the markdown processing could be speeded up by the
support of the C implementation of Markdown called
[Sundown](https://github.com/tanoku/sundown).

>> Sundown doesn't appear to have Perl bindings, so the cost of calling a

>> be worth looking into Text::Upskirt instead, which uses the Upskirt
>> library which Sundown appears to be derived from. -- [[KathrynAndersen]]
