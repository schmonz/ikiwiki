]]The [[plugins/table]] plugin's "`class`" argument is a pretty useful
shortcut, and it would be nice to provide at least one example class
designed for use with tables pre-defined in ikiwiki. I've written a
quick, minimal one that makes the table full-width (and some very
minimal, useful table styling) called `fullwidth_table` — please
consider merging it. Thanks! — [[Jon]][[!tag wishlist patch]]
