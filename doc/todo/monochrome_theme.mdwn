]][As requested](http://jmtd.net/log/goodreads/), please find a new theme named
'monochrome' in listed git repo/branch. [Here's the screenshot of what it looks like](https://github.com/jmtd/ikiwiki/blob/30af2437cd41d394930864e93b3c2319d1ec2b06/doc/themes/monochrome.png). — [[Jon]]

Perhaps controversially, I think that this would be a good basis for a default theme for the ikiwiki website. (I suspect more work is needed, I have not tested the theme against every plugin which provides theme-able bits and pieces, nor with e.g. HTML5 mode turned on, etc. etc.) Whilst the anti-theme is the best default for an ikiwiki instance (although an argument could be made against that, too!), the site needs to try to advertise some of the potential of ikiwiki to visitors, and serve as an example of what can be done. I'd appreciate thoughts of frequent ikiwiki contributors on this proposal ☺  — [[Jon]]

>> Sure I'll sort that out.  Sorry, I didn't realise the prepending was an automatic process. I did it manually. It should be quick for me to fix. — [[Jon]]

>>> Fixed. I rebased the branch; hopefully that won't cause your script issues.  — [[Jon]]
