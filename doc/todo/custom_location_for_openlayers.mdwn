In the [[plugins/osm]], we use an absolute URL to download the OpenLayers.js script file. This has two downsides:

 1. if the wiki is behind HTTPS, this will create a nasty SSL warning in the browser and we don't want that
 2. if we want the map to work offline, we need to load the js locally

For those reasons, I think the location of that script should be customizable. --[[anarcat]]

There is now a [[patch]] for this, thanks to Genevieve, available in my master branch.

Note that there's an update to the patch in my master branch, that allows changing the URL for tiles too.
