If a logged-in user is both a comment moderator and an admin, it would be nice if you could tick a box to ban the poster of a comment (or their IP if not signed in. Or their IP, AND their login if signed in, I suppose.) via the comment moderation interface.  Presently, you must view the back-end files to establish who posted the comment (the IP is not exposed in the moderation interface yet.) â€” [[Jon]]
