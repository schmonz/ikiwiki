It would be really nice if, should a page happen to have a title metavariable then links to that page which do not explicitly state a title would use it. -- Daniel Silverstone

> i like the idea for some applications, but i'm afraid there would be lots of cases where it wouldn't be appropriate to happen automatically, first and foremost capitalization. a syntax like ``\[[|that page]]`` might still be available, as the current implementation assumes the ``|`` character to be part of the page name. --[[chrysn]]
