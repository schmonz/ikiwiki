The idea behind this would be to have one ikiwiki behave as a dynamic private wiki in a specified area
and a more static publiczone wiki. Actually private wiki page can be addressed via a *pagespec*. 

What is ready /can be done:

* We already can more or less do this for example with [[httpauth|/plugins/httpauth/]], *.htaccess* files and a proper *httpauth_pagespec*
yet at the cost of maintaining two different user/pass logbase (native ikiwiki signin)
* Furthermore we can [[lockedit|plugins/lockedit/]] some pagespecs, ie in the public zone.

What is problematic is when you link a public page in a private page : 
a backlink will be generated from the public page to the private page.

As I noticed in [[per_page_ACLs]] in the end users through backlink 
navigation will frequently hit HTTP/401 deterring browsing as well as for the admin at false-positive logwatching.

One can radically [[disable backlinks feature|todo/allow_disabling_backlinks]] but then no more neat backlink navigation that
is really good to have in both area.

I think of just preventing this backlink leak in that case would be sufficient via i.e a *privatebacklinks* config and
a below patch.

Comments are welcome.
