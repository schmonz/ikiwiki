I wanted to produce an external link from a ikiwiki Subpage based on
the *basename* of the Subpage. So I added the following code to the
edittemplate plugin:

       my ($basename) = $page =~ m!.*/(.*)!;
       $template->param(basename => $basename || $page);

Is there any other way I could have achieved this?
