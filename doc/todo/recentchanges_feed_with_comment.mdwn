There is currently know clean way to extract the actual "description" the user provided for a change in the recent changes. They get displayed in the "description" blob of the recent changes, but only as HTML and alongside the diff blob and other things.

It would be nice if the user's "description" (the git commitlog, really) would be a first class citizen, because right now the RSS feed titles only say "user: change to page/blah", which is really not informative. We should at least have the commitlog available as a field. -- [[anarcat]]
