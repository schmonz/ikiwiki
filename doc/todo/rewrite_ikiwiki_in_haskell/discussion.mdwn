I'm torn about this idea, if it's actually serious.  I'm very comfortable
programming in Perl, and have written quite a few modules for IkiWiki, and
it would be a huge pain to have to start from scratch all over again. On
the other hand, this could be a motivation for me to learn Haskell.  My
only encounter with Haskell has been a brief time when I was using the
Xmonad window manager, but it looks like an interesting language.
Functional programming is cool.

There are a lot of interesting plusses for Haskell you note (in the parent
page), but it's true that the idea is horribly daunting (as [[Joey]] said
"If only I had a spare year").  Is there any way that you could "start
small"?  Because nothing will ever happen if the task is too daunting to
even start.

On further thought... perhaps it would be easier to fork or contribute to
an existing Haskell-based wiki, such as <a
href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>?

Rather than coding plugins for the Perl ikiwiki in Haskell, I wonder how easily a Haskell ikiwiki could still support plugins written in Perl? The (old and apparently stale) [HsPerl5](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HsPerl5) package might provide a helpful starting point there. -- [[JoshTriplett]]
