This patches enables the user to specify additional paths (“link bases”)
that can be used by ikiwiki when trying to resolve links. The list of
link bases is built as follows:

* the page itself (as ikiwiki currently does)
* all link bases specified for this page
* all link bases specified for pagespecs matched by this page

To specify the link bases, the only way made available presently by the
patchset is a linkbase plugin that works similarly to the shortcut
plugin (link bases are specified in a linkbases.mdwn file at the
document root). However, are ways are potentially possible.

This is still work in progress. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
