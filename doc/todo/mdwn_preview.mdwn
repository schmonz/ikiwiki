ikiwiki needs a wysiwyg markdown editor. While there have been tries using
WMD etc, they are not fully satisfactory, and also the license of
everything around WMD is [[unclear|plugins/wmd/discussion]].

[Hallo](https://github.com/bergie/hallo) is the closest to a solution
I've seen.
The user can edit the page by clicking on the html part they want to change
and typing. Selecting text pops up a toolbar to modify it.

[Demo of Hallo with live WYSIWYG markdown editing](http://bergie.github.com/hallo/markdown.html)
This demo uses showdown, and I still don't know what the license of
showdown is. However, the showdown part seems to only be to handle the live
conversion from the markdown source in the edit field to the html. The 
(edited) html to markdown conversion is accomplished by Hallo.

So, ikiwiki could use this in a page edit UI that does not show the
markdown at all. The user would edit the live page, entirely in wysiwyg
mode, and on saving hallo's generated markdown would be saved. Probably
there would need to be a button to bring up the current markdown editor
too, but without showdown, changes in it would not immediatly preview, so
it'd make sense to disable hallo when the editor is visible.

Issue: Ikiwiki directives can generate html. We would not want that html to
be editable by halo and converted back to markdown. Also, the directives
need to appear in the html so users can edit them. This seems to call for a
special page rendering mode for editing, in which directives are either not
expanded, or are expanded but the generated html wrapped in some tag that
makes hallo refuse to edit it (which would probably require that feature be
added to hallo, currently it acts on all blocks with `class=editable`),
or otherwise allows it to be stripped out at save time. --[[Joey]]

### old discussion


The [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) site uses markdown for markup.
It has a fancy javascript thing for showing a real-time preview of what the user
is editing. It would be nice if ikiwiki could support this, too. The thing they
use on StackOverflow is supposed to be free software, so it should be easy to
add to ikiwiki.

Note that the WMD plugin does **not** handle directives.  For this reason the normal `preview` button
remains.  Some CSS to clean up the display of the live WMD preview would be good.
