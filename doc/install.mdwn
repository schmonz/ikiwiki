This page documents how to install ikiwiki if a prepackaged version is not
available for your distribution, and you are faced with [[downloading|download]]
the source and installing by hand. Ikiwiki should work on most unix-like
systems.

## Dependencies

Ikiwiki is a perl program, and needs a recent version of perl such as
5.10. (5.8.0 has been reported not to work).

It's recommended you have a C compiler, as ikiwiki uses one to build
wrappers.

Ikiwiki requires the [[!cpan Text::Markdown::Discount]] (or 
[[!cpan Text::Markdown]]), [[!cpan URI]],
[[!cpan HTML::Parser]], [[!cpan HTML::Template]], [[!cpan YAML::XS]] and [[!cpan HTML::Scrubber]]
perl modules be installed. 
It can also use a lot of other perl modules, if
they are available.

Various [[plugins]] use other perl modules and utilities; see their individual
documentation for details.

### Installing dependencies by hand

If you want to install by hand from the tarball, you should make sure that
all the perl modules are installed. This is one way to install them, using
CPAN:

	PERL5LIB=`pwd` PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("Bundle::IkiWiki")'
	PERL5LIB=`pwd` PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("Bundle::IkiWiki::Extras")'

## Installing ikiwiki by hand

Then to build and install ikiwiki:

	perl Makefile.PL # PREFIX=/dir to install elsewhere
	make
	make test # optional
	make install

If you're using a shared hosting provider, of the sort where you don't have
root, you can still install ikiwiki. There are tutorials covering this for
a few providers:
