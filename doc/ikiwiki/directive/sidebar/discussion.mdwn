Things can get messy if you have enabled the global sidebar setting and you browse the `ikiwiki/directive/*` pages. You will get the content of `ikiwiki/directive/sidebar` as a sidebar to all the directives page... I have emptied the sidebar.mdwn page on our wiki to work around that, but isn't this a bug? --[[anarcat]]

>> Yep, this all sounds wrong... Maybe we could add a global "sidebar exclusion" pattern? Or reverse, allow customizing what name the global sidebar functionality is looking for? For example, we could look for `globalsidebar.mdwn` page instead of just `sidebar.mdwn`? --[[anarcat]]
