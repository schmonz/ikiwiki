The `trailoptions` directive is supplied by the
[[!iki plugins/trail desc=trail]] plugin. It sets options for the
trail represented by this page.

    \[[!trailoptions sort="meta(title)" circular="no"]]

Options available:

* `sort`: sets a [[ikiwiki/pagespec/sorting]] order for the entire trail,
  overriding the order in which they were added

* `reverse`: reverses the order of the trail

* `circular`: if set to `yes` or `1`, the trail is made into a loop by
  making the last page's "next" link point to the first page, and the first
  page's "previous" link point to the last page

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
