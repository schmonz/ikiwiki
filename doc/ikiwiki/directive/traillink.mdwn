The `traillink` directive is supplied by the
[[!iki plugins/trail desc=trail]]
plugin. It generates a visible [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]], and also adds the
linked page to the trail represented by the page containing the directive.

In its simplest form, the first parameter is like the content of a WikiLink:

    \[[!traillink some_other_page]]

The displayed text can also be overridden, either with a `|` symbol or with
a `text` parameter:

    \[[!traillink Click_here_to_start_the_trail|some_other_page]]
    \[[!traillink some_other_page text="Click here to start the trail"]]

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
