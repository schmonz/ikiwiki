[Amitai Schlair](http://www.schmonz.com/) finds himself using ikiwiki
for all sorts of things. His attempts at contributing:

[[!map
pages="!*/Discussion and ((link(users/schmonz) and plugins/*) or rcs/cvs)"
]]

He's also written a plugin for [WIND
authentication](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/rad/authmethods/wind/), which
may or may not be of general utility.
