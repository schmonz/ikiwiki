I've been using IkiWiki for [my personal site](https://jmtd.net/)
since 2008, as well as a number of private instances.
[[I joined the IkiWiki maintainers in 2024|contact]].

## contributions

I've worked on a few different issues and bugs over the years (they
are probably linked in "Backlinks", below). I slowly maintain
the [Opinionated Ikiwiki](https://github.com/jmtd/opinionated-ikiwiki/)
[[container|containers]]. I have recently taken on the Debian packaging.
My current focus is working upstream.

## historic

I gave a talk at the [UK UNIX User's Group](http://www.ukuug.org/) annual
[Linux conference](http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2008/) in 2008 about
organising system administrator documentation. Roughly a third of this talk
was discussing IkiWiki in some technical detail and suggesting it as a good
piece of software for this task.
