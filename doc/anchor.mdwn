ikiwiki works with anchors in various situations.

You can insert anchors directly in the body of a page and it will be used on the resulting HTML, for example:

    <a name="anchor"></a>

... will make the link [[anchor#anchor]] work..

<a name="anchor"></a>

This page accumulates links to the concept of anchors.
